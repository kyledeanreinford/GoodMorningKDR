# GoodMorningKDR

I found myself opening the same tabs every morning like a robot, so I decided to create an Ubuntu dock item to automate it. You can edit the tabs being opened in the .py file. 

.desktop file must be placed in {user}/.local/share/applications

Right click on icon and add to favorites to add icon to Ubuntu dock. 

Requires Python.
